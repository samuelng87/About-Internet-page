    <header>What is internet?</header>
        
     <p>You're watching this, probably using some sort of web browser.
        In the browser, there's the video itself. 
        Maybe up at the top there's some images, off to the side is some text.
        Maybe somewhere on the page you can click a link, click a button, and
        something else on the page will change, or you'll go to a different page.
     </p>

     <p>How does all that work? <br>
        How does the content get from somewhere else to your computer? <br>
        What software is running? <br>
        And how can you as a software developer create that? <br>
    </p>

    <p> Those are things we're going to look at in this.
        Well it's the 21st century, you're watching this page.
        You probably have some idea of what the Internet is.
        But the internet is of course this global network of machines, some of them known as
        servers which have data or content that they make available to other machines.
        Clients, which is where humans are using the machine to get data or
        maybe send data.</p>

    <p>So is WWW <b>World Wide Web</b> an internet? No! there are not the same!</p> 
    
        <p>The Internet is the network, is the hardware.</p>

        <p>The World Wide Web we can think of as the software.
        The World Wide Web is an application that is running on the network,
        on top of the Internet.</p>


        <p>The Internet is providing the infrastructure that the World Wide Web is
        using that infrastructure to transfer transmit data.</p>

        <p>So what is the World Wide Web?</p>
        <p>The World Wide We is an application that runs on top of the Internet.
        It combines various protocols to allow for communication and 
        transfer of data between machines.</p>

        <p>The web is composed of documents that are linked to each other.
        Now, originally, the World Wide Web was designed to allow for
        this access to all these documents and to link them together.
        And that we could get from one document to another
        using something known as the web browser. </p>

            <p> <b>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) </b> - Alphanumeric string of charaters used to uniquely 
                identify a Wed page or resouce. </p>


            <p><b>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</b> type of URI that specifies the location on the 
                WWW and the mechanism (protocol) for retrieving it.</p>
            

            <p>How do we identify or address content on the World Wide Web?</p>

            <p>Generally speaking, every piece of content has what's known as a URI, or
                uniform resource identifier, that's just a unique address on the World Wide Web.
                The URL, or uniform resource locator, is a type of URI,
                it's a type of address that specifies not only the location on the World Wide Web,
                but the protocol or the mechanism for accessing it.</p>

        <img src="https://www.websolutionwinner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Top-11-Most-Popular-Web-Browsers-in-2019.jpg" alt="Top-11-Most-Popular-Web-Browsers-in-2019">
        
        
        <p>Web browser is a piece of software that is used to access and display content.</p>
        <p>That it finds on the world wide web, and let you navigate from one location, one document to another.</p>
        <p>The browser contains three main components, and these are the three, I suppose, cornerstones of web content, and
            the three things we're going to look at in this course.</p>
        <p>The first main component of the web browser is known as the rendering engine.</p>
        <p>The rendering engine is what decides what to display and how to display it within the web browser.</p>
            </section>
            
    <section class="main-section" id="http">
            <header>HTTP</header>
            

        <p>HTTP or <b> Hypertext Transfer Protocol. </b> </p> 
        
        <p>HTTP is how the web browser communicates with other devices,
            other computers, on the World Wide Web To request and transfer documents.
            HTTP is a client server protocol.
            There's some computer, which is known as the client.
        </p>   
         <p>It could be your mobile device.</p>
         <p>It could be your refrigerator.</p>
          <p>But, something that's on the world wide web.
            And, there's some server.
            The server is generally some big computer that's Somewhere else, on the Internet,
            and they're connected of course by the Internet through various connections and
            devices a long the way.</p>

        <p> In HTTP the client initiates the conversation or
            the transfer of the data by sending what's known as an HTTP request,
            the server is out there listening for incoming request and
            the client sends the request saying Server, can you please give me some data?</p>
        <p> The server then decides what to do with that request and
            sends back what's known as the HTTP response.
            The HTTP response includes the content that the client requested,
            and then the client figures out what to do with that content.
            HTTP is a plain-text, human-readable protocol that's used for
            exchanging data on the web.</p>
        <p> What that means is that if you could open up your web browser and
            look at the data that's going back and forth, it's just text.
            You would be able to read it.
            HTTP is based on the client-server model.</P>
        <p> The client sends a request, which is not only the content that its asking for,
            but also information about the client.
            The server sends back the requested resource or content or page or data, but
            also information about the server itself. </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="html">
            <header>HTML</header>
            

            <p> HTML or <b>Hypertext Markup Language </b>is a way of structuring content or
                structuring data on the World Wide Web. </p>

            <p>An HTML document consists of elements.</p>
               
            <p>An element consists of tags generally followed by then some content and
                what's known as the closing tag or end tag.</p>
                
            <p>Here's an example of some HTML content.
                It starts with a start tag, it's the content itself and
                then there's some end tag.
                So in this lesson, we'll start to look at HTML and we'll look at
                the different types of tags and how they relate to what you see in the web browser.
                In the same way that HTTP is a plain text human readable protocol,
                HTML is a plain text human readable language.</p>

            <p> That means that you as a human can read HTML and see the content and
                see the data and the structure of that content.
                Now it's important to note that strictly speaking, HTML is a way of
                structuring the data but does not decide or determine how to display it.
                So HTML says here is the content, here is how
                pieces of content relate to each other, but it doesn't say how to display it.
                It's up to the web browser to choose how to display that content.</p>
